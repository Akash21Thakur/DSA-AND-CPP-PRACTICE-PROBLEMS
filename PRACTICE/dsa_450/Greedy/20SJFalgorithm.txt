The shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy that
selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. 
SJN, also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN), can be preemptive or non-preemptive.  

Algorithm: 

1. Sort all the processes according to the arrival time. 
2. Then select that process that has minimum arrival time and minimum Burst time. 
3. After completion of the process make a pool of processes that arrives afterward 
   till the completion of the previous process and select that process among the pool 
   which is having minimum Burst time.
